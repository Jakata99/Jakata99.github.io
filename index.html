      <p>This is a basic static web page and has few aims. Firstly, it tries to sumarise my progress and 
        keep me even more motivated. It can also be a reference and guidence for future employers, who may want to learn more about their candidate.

       <p>This is not formal page, but rather, just for more personal view. It covers my 
        journey in software engrineering, applications that I have learned so far, as well as my future plans. 
        The page is new, and it will be updated frequently.

      <h2>A decision towards change!</h2>
      <p class="journey-text">
        Like many things in life, it all happened completely by chance. I was 
        on a vacation in Spain visiting relatives. At this time, I was a fresh graduate from university, still trying to figure out what I want to be doing.
        Who could guess that a conversation with my cousin would make me consider to try out something completely different.
        After some time, I decided to give programming a try, and signed for SoftUni without previous any experience. One week into it, 
        and I already loved it. After few months studying while 
        working full time in London, I decided to go back to Bulgaria permanently. This was a changing moment for me, as I can now dedicate fully. It took me 
        until mid-april until I convinced myself to specialise in the front-end web development field. As of today (6th June), I am still fully-commiting my time 
        in learning new things and improving with a speed that I can handle.

        <p>So far, I have successfully passed both 'Basics' and 'Fundamentals' with 100/100 at Python. Very recently, 
          I changed my Path to JS-Advanced + JS/Applications as part of my commitment to learn web development.</p>

      <h2>My future Plan</h2>
      <p>
        All the things mentioned above are just basic guidelines of my self-study so far. 
        I will be updating the skills section frequently, as well as any additional touches in my free time. 

        So here is a list of things I am going to focus on during June and July: 
      </p><br>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Smashing my currently-enrolled Javascript-Advanced course from SoftUni.
        </li>
        <li>
          Further enhance my Javascript knowledge through building more complicated logic-based challenges.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create more complex web applications (either a fine copycat of any popular website or my own website design).
        </li>
        <li>
          At some point, I will start learning a JS Framework, once I feel confident (Hopefully, by the end of June).
        </li>
      </ul>
